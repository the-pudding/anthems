We also included a few notable anthem performances prior to 1980."},{"type":"text","value":"We then set out to find a suitable audio/video recording of the performance on YouTube. We were able to find roughly 180 performances. Using a <a href=https://ytmp3.nu/CNtD/>free online converter</a>, we extracted mp3 audio files from each YouTube link. We then manually trimmed the mp3 audio files so that they started right before the first word in the anthem and ended after the last. The trimmed audio was then uploaded to an AI-powered <a href=https://vocalremover.org/>Vocal Remover</a> program to isolate the vocals from the rest of the audio."},{"type":"text","value":"Once we had the isolated vocal files, we loaded them into <a href=https://www.sonicvisualiser.org/tony/>Tony</a>, an open source melody transcription tool developed by the Centre for Digital Music at Queen Mary, University of London. Along with 4 additional data assistants (Amel Awadelkarim, Dustin D’Andrea, Noah Fagan, and George McIntire), we listened to each vocal track and manually removed errant sounds (crowd noise, echos, jet flyovers, band accompaniments) and corrected pitch (usually moving the notes up or down an octave). Some songs were dropped at this stage due to overall poor audio quality."},{"type":"text","value":"We then exported the notes data and pitch data (the lines you see in this piece). To get exact timestamps for each word and phrase, we manually tagged the notes data with each word in the lyrics (“O”, “say”, “can”, “you”, “see”). We split the song into 16 phrases at natural pauses or breaths. To verify the timestamps of each phrase, we built a tool that allowed us to listen and manually tag start and stop times. Some specific phrases for specific performances were also dropped at this stage due to poor audio quality. This process took over 100 hours of work and we couldn’t have done it without our data assistants, so thank you!"},{"type":"text","value":"For each phrase, we used a Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) algorithm to compare it to the corresponding phrase in a “standard” performance of the National Anthem — in this case, an <a href=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Star_Spangled_Banner_instrumental.ogg>instrumental by the United States Navy Band</a>. DTW calculates the cumulative distance between the performer’s rendition and the standard at various points along the length of the phrase. In other words, it measures the amount a performer deviates from the standard melody, giving us the Diva Score for each phrase. The Diva Score for the full performance is a sum of the Diva Scores by phrase."},{"type":"text","value":"Because the note data and the pitch data exported from Tony were at the sub-millisecond level, we had to compress the data in order to display it. To do this we took the average value for each millisecond, removing any zero values. The charts in this piece are a simplification of the full pitch data, but they still accurately reflect what you hear while listening to the audio."},{"type":"text","value":"Thank you also to our colleague <a href=https://pudding.cool/author/kevin-litman-navarro/>Kevin Litman-Narvarro</a> who originally planted the idea of looking into National Anthem performances."}]}
